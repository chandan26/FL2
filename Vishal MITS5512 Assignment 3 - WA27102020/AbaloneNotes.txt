The Data file "Abalone Data Set" is a Microsoft Spreadsheet file containing 4177 instances of data on Abalone from a Tasmanian Fisheries source

There are 8 attributes in the file for each Abalone instance



Attribute information:

   Below is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a
   brief description.  

	Name		Data Type	Meas.	Description
	----		---------	-----	-----------
	Sex		nominal			M, F, and I (infant)
	Length		continuous	mm	Longest shell measurement
	Diameter	continuous	mm	perpendicular to length
	Height		continuous	mm	with meat in shell
	Whole weight	continuous	grams	whole abalone
	Shucked weight	continuous	grams	weight of meat
	Viscera weight	continuous	grams	gut weight (after bleeding)
	Shell weight	continuous	grams	after being dried
	Rings		integer			+1.5 gives the age in years

 

The rings in an Abalone shell give a measurements of age and ideally this is a value we would like too be able to predict and counting the rings involves drilling through the Abalone shell. But what other relationships exist?
